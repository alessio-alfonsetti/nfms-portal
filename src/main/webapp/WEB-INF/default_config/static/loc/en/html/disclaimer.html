<h1>Welcome to the DRC National Forest Monitoring System</h1>

<p>The DRC National Forest Monitoring system (NFMS) is being developed by the DRC government in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (<a href="http://www.fao.org" target="_blank">FAO UN</a>) and the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (<a href="http://www.inpe.br/" target="_blank">INPE</a>), with financial support from the <a href="http://www.un-redd.org/" target="_blank">UN-REDD</a> programme. It is developed in response to the relevant REDD+ decisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<a href="http://unfccc.int/" target="_blank">UNFCCC</a>), in particular the Decision 1/CP.16, which requests developing country Parties that undertake REDD+ activities to develop a robust and transparent national forest monitoring system for the five <a href="http://www.un-redd.org/AboutREDD/tabid/582/Default.aspx" target="_blank">REDD+</a> activities. These activities are: deforestation, forest degradation, forest conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.</p>

<p>The DRC NFMS brings together data from many sources, as acknowledged in the description of each respective data layer, and aims to combine them into a  forest management tool related to REDD+ specifically and  more generally on the DRC&apos;s forests policies and measures.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Environment, Conservation of Nature and Tourism is extremely grateful to various partners (USAID, CARPE, UMD, OSFAC, WRI, Greenpeace International, UCL, WWF, OFAC) for providing their datasets to the DRC NFMS. In particular, the Ministry of Environment, Conservation of Nature and Tourism wishes to thank the <a href="http://www.fao.org" target="_blank">FACET<a> partners (USAID, CARPE, UMD, OSFAC) for providing key data on forest cover loss for the period of 2000-2010.</p>

<p>The DRC NFMS is currently running on a 'beta version' as data is currently being processed and feedback from various national and international partners is being incorporated. The DRC government aims to present a 'full' version at the 18th Conference of the Parties (COP18) in December 2012, when it will incorporate a first set of official, national annual deforestation statistics. The Portal is built on open source projects, notably OpenLayers, JQuery, HighCharts (client).</p>
