<h2>Intact Forest</h2>
<p>An Intact Forest Landscape (IFL) is an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within the zone of current forest extent, showing no signs of significant human activity, and large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. The national IFL map is the first assessment of large undeveloped forest areas based Landsat satellite imagery and it represents IFl area change from year 2000 to 2010. The IFL concept and map have been developed by the IFL Mapping team (Greenpeace, World Resources Institute, and University of Maryland).</p>
<p>All up-to-date IFL maps and IFL monitoring results are available online on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intactforests.org">IFL</a></p>
