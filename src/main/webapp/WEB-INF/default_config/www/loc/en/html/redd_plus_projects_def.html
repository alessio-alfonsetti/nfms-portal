<h2>REDD+ Project</h2>
<p>A series of activities aiming to modify the dynamics of deforestation and/or forest degradation and/or to increase forest carbon stocks, within a delimited geographical area, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  linked to these dynamics. A results based compensation mechanism ( based on funds or carbon market) has been put into place to validate and encourage these reductions. The emissions must be measured, monitored and validated according to a methodology previously approved by an internationally recognized institution. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are measured according to a plausible reference level previously established according to the  methodology enforced by the host country.</p>
