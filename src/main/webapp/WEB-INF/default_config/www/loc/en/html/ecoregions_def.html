<h2>Ecoregions</h2>
<p>
Based on: Global Ecoregions, Major Habitat Types, Biogeographical Realms and The Nature Conservancy Terrestrial Assessment Units as of December 14, 2009. Developed originally by Olson, D. M. and E. Dinerstein (2002), Bailey (1995) and Environment Canada (Wiken, 1986), and modified by The Nature Conservancy (TNC). Ecoregions are relatively large units of land containing distinct assemblages of natural communities and species, with boundaries that approximate the original extent of natural communities prior to major land-use change.  Ecoregions are nested within two higher-order classifications: biomes (14) and biogeographic realms (8).</p>
